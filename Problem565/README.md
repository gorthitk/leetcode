### Problem 565. Array Nesting

### Description
	A zero-indexed array A consisting of N different integers is given. The array contains all integers in the range [0, N - 1].

	Sets S[K] for 0 <= K < N are defined as follows:

	S[K] = { A[K], A[A[K]], A[A[A[K]]], ... }.

	Sets S[K] are finite for each K and should NOT contain duplicates.

	Write a function that given an array A consisting of N integers, return the size of the largest set S[K] for this array.
