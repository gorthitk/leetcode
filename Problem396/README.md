### Problem 396. Rotate Function

### Description
	Given an array of integers A and let n to be its length.

	Assume Bk to be an array obtained by rotating the array A k positions clock-wise, we define a "rotation function" F on A as follow:

	F(k) = 0 * Bk[0] + 1 * Bk[1] + ... + (n-1) * Bk[n-1].

	Calculate the maximum value of F(0), F(1), ..., F(n-1).
