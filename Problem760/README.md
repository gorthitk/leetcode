### Problem 760. Find Anagram Mappings 

### Description
    Given two lists Aand B, and B is an anagram of A. B is an anagram of A means B is made by randomizing the order of the elements in A.
    
    We want to find an index mapping P, from A to B. A mapping P[i] = j means the ith element in A appears in B at index j.
    
    These lists A and B may contain duplicates. If there are multiple answers, output any of them.
