### Problem 598. Range Addition II

### Description
	Given an m * n matrix M initialized with all 0's and several update operations.

	Operations are represented by a 2D array, and each operation is represented by an array with two positive integers a and b, which means M[i][j] should be added by one for all 0 <= i < a and 0 <= j < b.

	You need to count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.
